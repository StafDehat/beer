Notes:
This looks like mud.  Gotta filter or add clarifier, or use darker grains or something.

Grain bag:
2 cups quaker oats, roasted on a baking sheet (optional)
0.5 lb Munich
0.5 lb CaraPils
0.5 lb chocolate malt

Sugars:
6.6 lb light liquid malt extract (LME)

Flavourings:
8 oz Hersey's cocoa powder
8 oz raw cacao nibs
2.0 oz dried red peppers

Hops:
1 oz Saaz pellets
0.75 oz Yakima pellets

Yeast:
White labs belgian saison 1 (WLP565)


Remove yeast from fridge, shake it up, set it aside.  The cabinet above the stove works well.

If you're going to use the oats, toast 'em now.
Bring about 2 gallons of water to about 150F.
Steep grain bag for 30 minutes
Remove grain bag, allow to drip dry-ish
Bring to boil
Remove from heat
While stirring, add sugars.
Return to heat, bring to boil.

Countdown from 60 minutes:
60m: Add 0.5 oz Saaz hops.  They'll boil up a lot, so add them a bit at a time.
15m: Add 1 tub of 8oz Hershey's cocoa powder
    Add 0.75oz Yakima hops.
    Add 0.5oz red peppers
    Optional: 1 whirlfloc tablet, or 1oz irish moss
5m: Add 0.5 oz Saaz hops.

Add 10+ lbs ice to fermenting bucket
Pour hot wort over ice.  Drop temp to less than 80F.
Add water to make 5.25 gallons.
Add yeast.
Stir to aerate.
Seal it up, ferment at least 1 week.

Dump the cacao nibs and 1.5 oz red peppers into your carboy.
Siphon beer from bucket into the carboy.
Seal carboy with stopper and airlock, place in a dark place.  Light exposure to the hop compounds would skunk your beer.
Ferment at least 1 week.
Bottle or keg as normal.
