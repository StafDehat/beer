Specialty grains:
0.25 lb flaked wheat
0.75 lb malted wheat
0.25 lb 6-row malt
0.25 lb vienna malt

Sugars:
6-7 lbs bavarian wheat LME
3 lbs (1 can) Apricot puree w/ pectic enzyme (20 drops liquid or ⅓ tsp powder)

Hops:
1.0 oz hallertauer hops - bittering
1.0 oz tettnanger hops - ½ flavour, ½ aroma

Yeast:
WLP380 Hefe IV or WLP300 Hefe if unavailable

Procedure:
Shake and set aside yeast in a warm place.
Heat 2.5 gallons water to 150F
Steep specialty grains for 25-30 minutes
Strain through sieve to remove grains, return liquid to stove
Bring to boil
Remove from heat long enough to dissolve LME, then return to boil

The boil (60m total):
60m: 1.0 oz German hallertauer hops
15m: 0.5 oz German tettnanger hops
2m: 0.5 oz German tettnanger hops

Place pot in sink of cold water until water in sink is too hot to touch.
Add 10 lbs ice to primary fermentation bucket
Pour hot wort over ice
Add water to reach 5.25 gallons total
Verify temperature is <80F.  If too hot, wait to cool.
Add yeast, seal, allow to ferment.

When fermentation slows to 20-30 seconds between bubbles (~3 days), mix apricot puree with pectic enzyme, let rest for 1 hour, then add to fermenter.
Ferment another 2 weeks, then bottle/keg.
It’ll be sour initially, but the apricot flavour mellows/blends over time.  It’s very good about 4 weeks after bottling/kegging.
