"The Black is Beautiful initiative is a collaborative effort amongst the brewing community and its customers, in an attempt to bring awareness to the injustices that many people of color face daily. Our mission is to bridge the gap that's been around for ages and provide a platform to show that the brewing community is an inclusive place for everyone of any color. We are asking for all breweries and brewers far and wide to raise a glass with us in unison and participate in this collaboration."

This is my personal variation on a recipe written by Marcus Baskerville, head brewer and co-owner of Weathered Souls Brewing Company, based in San Antonio, TX.
Marcus provides this recipe free-of-charge to all breweries and homebrewers, with the goal of raising money and awareness for racial equality.
Everyone is welcome to this information, but I would ask that you also read the information provided by Marcus here:

Variant on commercial recipe:
--------------------------------------------------
"Mayorial Stout"
Mash temp: 154F
Strike water: 4.5 gallons
My Grain temp: 77F
My Strike temp: 165F

6.5  lb Vienna malt
1.25 lb Carafoam
1.5  lb Flaked oats
1.25 lb Crystal-120L
0.5  lb Chocolate malt (350srm)
1.0  lb Black patent malt (500 srm)
0.5  lb Rice hulls

2oz cascade @T-60m (~16 IBU)
1oz cascade @T-30m (~5 IBU)
1oz cascade @T-10m (~2 IBU)

WLP001 California ale yeast

12.0 oz Dextrose (corn/priming sugar) @T-10m

Notes on changes:
I avoid 2-row whenever possible.  It contributes very little in terms of body or flavour.  Vienna should give a bit more breadiness.
My Brewer's Edge mash & boil works best at around 12 lbs grain, so percentages were approximated off 192oz (12lbs).  Rice hulls & Dextrose were supplemental to that.
I'm paranoid of a stuck mash, so whenever there are oats, I also add rice hulls.

Variant on homebrew recipe:

"Oatmeal Stout"
Mash temp: 154F
Strike water: 5 gal
My Grain temp: 77F
My Strike temp: 

8.0  lbs Vienna malt
2.0  lbs 6-row malt
2.0  lbs Flaked oats
1.0  lbs Chocolate malt
0.75 lbs Flaked barley
0.75 lbs Crystal-120L
0.75 lbs Roasted barley
0.5  lbs Chocolate rye

1.0 oz Columbus hops @T-60m (
2.0 oz Cascade hops  @T-20m (
2.0 oz Cascade hops  @T-10m (

WLP001 California Ale yeast

Notes on variations:
2-row sucks.  Using Vienna to get more maltiness.
2-row sucks.  Using 6-row to get more diastatic enzymes.
There's flaked wheat & barley, so we're using rice hulls to insure against a stuck mash.
