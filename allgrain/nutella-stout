The mash:
0.5 lb (2 cups) flaked wheat (Quaker oats), roasted on a baking sheet (optional)
0.5 lb black patent malt
0.5 lb UK roasted barley (US is okay if UK is unavailable)
0.75 lb chocolate malt
0.5 lb rice hulls
0.6 lb 60L Crystal
7.2 lb 2-row
0.9 lb Munich

Sugars:
1.0 lb powdered lactose (Add to boil)

Adjuncts:
8 oz Hersey's cocoa powder
8 oz raw cacao nibs
0.5 oz hazelnut extract

Hops:
1 oz UK Kent Goldings pellets (Regular Kent Golding is OK if UK is unavailable)

Yeast:
White labs irish ale yeast (WLP004)



Remove yeast from fridge, shake it up, set it aside.  The cabinet above the stove works well.

If you're going to use the oats, toast 'em now.
Bring about 2 gallons of water to about 150F.
Steep grain bag for 30 minutes
Remove grain bag, allow to drip dry-ish
Bring to boil
Remove from heat
While stirring, add sugars.
Return to heat, bring to boil.

60m: Add hops.  They'll boil up a lot, so add them a bit at a time.
15m: Add 1 tub of 8oz Hershey's cocoa powder
     Optional: 1 whirlfloc tablet, or 1oz irish moss

Pour through strainer into fermenting bucket.
Add 10 lbs ice, or cool however you normally cool your wort.  Get down to about 80F.  Lower is fine.
Add water to make 5.25 gallons.
Add yeast.
Stir to aerate.
Seal it up, ferment at least 1 week.

Dump the cacao nibs into your carboy.
Siphon beer from bucket into the carboy.
Seal carboy with stopper and airlock, place in a dark place.  Light exposure to the hop compounds would skunk your beer.
Ferment at least 1 week.

Bottle or keg as normal.  Add the 1oz hazelnut extract at the same time as priming sugar (or directly to keg).
