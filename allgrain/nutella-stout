--- Mash
Consider lactic acid to bring water pH to ~7.0

0.5 lb (2 cups) flaked wheat (Quaker oats), roasted on a baking sheet (optional)
0.5 lb black patent malt
0.5 lb UK roasted barley (US is okay if UK is unavailable)
0.75 lb chocolate malt
0.5 lb rice hulls
0.6 lb 60L Crystal
7.2 lb 2-row
0.9 lb Munich

11.45 lb grain total, assumed 77F

Stike water:
150F strike temp +
1.48 qt per pound grain =
17.00 qts (4.25 gal) @ 159.7 (F)

NOTE: Recirculate during heating & mashing.
NOTE: This assumes your tun will absorb heat (a few degrees will be absorbed by the mash tun, this varies widely by the type of mash tun). Even if you 'pre-heat' the tun with a little boiling water, this may still be the case. Do not stabilize the tun at the strike temperature, and then add grains, or you will overshoot.
Conclusion: 4.25 gal @ 158F

Mash for 1 hour at 150F, while recirculating
Colder means drier beer and higher ABV.  Hotter means sweeter beer with lower ABV.
End with an iodine test.  Continue mashing as needed.


--- Mash-out
Heat sparge water to 170F.
Set Mash&Boil to 170F.
Continue recirculating.  Wait for heating.


--- Sparge
Cut heat to Sparge Water.  Allow to cool during sparge, as low as 165F.
  Water >170F during late sparging will extract unwanted tannins.
Sparge to total volume of ~6.5 gal (Mash & Boil loses ~1/2 gal per hour)
Discard grain.
On to the boil.


--- Boil
Sugars:
1.0 lb powdered lactose (Add to boil)

Adjuncts:
8 oz Hersey's cocoa powder
8 oz raw cacao nibs
0.5 oz hazelnut extract

Hops:
1 oz UK Kent Goldings pellets (Regular Kent Golding is OK if UK is unavailable)

Yeast:
White labs irish ale yeast (WLP004)



Remove yeast from fridge, shake it up, set it aside.  The cabinet above the stove works well.

Bring to boil, remove from heat.
While stirring, add lactose.
Return to heat, bring to boil.

60m: Add hops.  They'll boil up a lot, so add them a bit at a time.
15m: Add 1 tub of 8oz Hershey's cocoa powder
     Optional: 1 whirlfloc tablet, or 1oz irish moss

Pour through strainer into fermenting bucket.
Add 10 lbs ice, or cool however you normally cool your wort.  Get down to about 80F.  Lower is fine.
Add water to make 5.25 gallons.
Add yeast.
Stir to aerate.
Seal it up, ferment at least 1 week.

Rack to secondary.
Dump the cacao nibs into your carboy.
Siphon beer from bucket into the carboy.
Seal carboy with stopper and airlock, place in a dark place.  Light exposure to the hop compounds would skunk your beer.
Ferment at least 1 week.

Bottle or keg as normal.  Add hazelnut flavouring to taste (probably 0.25-0.5 oz)
